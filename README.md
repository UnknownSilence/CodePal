# CodePal

EDIT: The features of this app have been combined with a later development, the ProjectPal. For more features check it out at: https://github.com/UnknownSilence/ProjectPal.

Ever had problems coming up with project ideas?

With so many possibilities in the realm of software development, it can become overwhelming at times with
what seems like unlimited choices.

Because of this purgatory of indecisiveness, I made the CodePal, a project idea generator that randomly generates
idea combinations from a ever-expanding list of potential projects.




This project was made using Electron, a desktop application development library for Javascript.
